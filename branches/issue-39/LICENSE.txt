While most DKPro-TC modules are available under the Apache Software License (ASL) version 2, there
are a few modules that depend on external libraries and are thus licensed under the GPL. The license
of each individual module is specified in its LICENSE file.

It must be pointed out that while the component's source code itself is licensed under the ASL or
GPL, individual components might make use of third-party libraries or products that are not licensed
under the ASL or GPL. 

Please make sure that you are aware of the third party licenses and respect them.
