DKPro TC is a UIMA-based text classification framework built on top of [DKPro Core][DKPRO_CORE] and [DKPro Lab][DKPRO_LAB]. It is intended to facilitate supervised machine learning experiments with any kind of textual data. 

DKPro TC comes with

  * Getting-started example code for standard text collections, e.g. the Reuters-21578 Text Categorization corpus, in Java and Groovy
  * many generic feature extractors, e.g. n-grams, POS-tags etc.
  * convenient parameter optimization capabilities
  * comprehensive reporting with support for many standard performance measures
  * support for single- and multi-label classification, and regression in various frameworks, e.g. [CRFsuite][CRFSUITE], [DyNet][DYNET], [DeepLearning4j][DL4J], [LibLinear][LIBLINEAR], [LibSvm][LIBSVM], [Keras][KERAS], [SvmHmm][SVMHMM], [VowpalWabbit][VOWPALWABBIT], [Weka][WEKA] and [XGBoost][XGBOOST], 

If you want to use the latest (snapshot) version of DKPro TC, please mind that the project is subject to constant change.
